# Shared Life Planner ‚Äì Project Documentation

## üìò Project Overview

A full-stack web application designed for couples to collaboratively manage their shared life ‚Äî including tasks, goals, calendar events, and reminders. Each couple has their own private space in the app. The app is deployed and hosted by you and supports multiple couples using it concurrently.

## üß± Microservices Architecture

### 1. User Service

* Registers users
* Handles authentication (JWT)
* Supports couple linking (via invite code or approval)

### 2. Couple Service

* Manages couple data
* Links two users into a shared unit

### 3. Task Service

* Create, read, update, delete tasks
* Assign tasks to self or partner
* Couple-scoped tasks only

### 4. Goal Service

* Create and track shared/personal goals
* Progress tracking and milestone handling

### 5. Calendar Service

* Stores events and due dates
* Serves frontend-friendly calendar data

### 6. Reminder Service

* Handles scheduled reminders
* Sends email notifications for tasks/goals/events

### 7. API Gateway

* Unified entrypoint for frontend
* Routes requests to appropriate microservices
* Handles JWT validation

---

## üîê Security & Multi-Tenancy

* Every request includes a JWT token
* Each resource (task, goal, event) is scoped to a couple ID
* Access control enforced server-side on every API call

---

## üåê Frontend (Angular)

* Built with Angular 17+
* Uses Angular Router for navigation
* Uses Angular Material for UI components
* Features include:

  * Task board
  * Goal tracker
  * Calendar view
  * Reminder settings
  * Profile linking and management
